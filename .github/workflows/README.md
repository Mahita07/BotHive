## Workflow Permissions

All workflows require these permissions (already configured):
- `issues: write` - Create and modify issues
- `contents: read` - Read repository contents

These are set in the workflow files under the `permissions` section.

## Typical Workflow Sequence

### For Hacktoberfest Participation:

1. **Before Hacktoberfest** (Late September):
   ```
   1. Run "Generate Issues" (dry_run: false)
   2. Run "Add Hacktoberfest Label" (dry_run: false)
   3. Add "hacktoberfest" topic to repository
   ```

2. **During Hacktoberfest** (October):
   - Monitor issues and PRs
   - Labels are already applied
   - New issues can be created manually with the label

3. **After Hacktoberfest** (November):
   ```
   1. Run "Remove Hacktoberfest Label" (dry_run: false)
   2. Remove "hacktoberfest" topic from repository
   ```

### For Year-Round Open Source:

```
1. Run "Generate Issues" (dry_run: false)
2. Don't run Hacktoberfest workflows
3. Issues remain without Hacktoberfest branding
```

## Dry Run Best Practice

**Always run with `dry_run: true` first!**

This allows you to:
- Preview what will happen
- Check for errors
- Verify the changes are what you want
- Avoid mistakes

Then run with `dry_run: false` to apply changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails with "Permission denied"

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Actions** â†’ **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - Select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
3. Save and re-run workflow

### Issues not created

**Possible causes:**
- Duplicate issues already exist (check title match)
- Rate limiting (wait and retry)
- JSON syntax error in `issues.json`

**Fix:**
- Check workflow logs for errors
- Validate `issues.json` with a JSON validator
- Try dry run first

### Hacktoberfest label not added

**Check:**
- Issue is open (closed issues are skipped)
- Issue doesn't already have the label
- Issue matches filter criteria
- Label was created successfully
